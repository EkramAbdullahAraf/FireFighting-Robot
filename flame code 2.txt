int buzzer = 8 ;
int LED = 7 ;
int flame_sensor = 4 ;
int flame_detected ;
 

In this part of the code, we are going to set the status of digital pins of Arduino and configure

Baud rate for Serial communication with PC for displaying status of flame detection circuit.

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600) ;
  pinMode(buzzer, OUTPUT) ;
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT) ;
  pinMode(flame_sensor, INPUT) ;
}
 

This line of code reads the digital output from flame sensor and stores it in the variable “flame_detected”.

flame_detected = digitalRead(flame_sensor) ;
 

Based on the value stored in “flame_detected”, we have to turn on the buzzer and LED. In this part of the code, we compare the value stored in “flame_detected” with 0 or 1.

If its equal to 1, it indicates that flame has been detected. We have to turn on buzzer and LED and then display an alert message in Serial monitor of Arduino IDE.

If its equal to 0, then it indicates that no flame has been detected so we have to turn off LED and buzzer. This process is repeated every second to identify the presence of fire or flame.

if (flame_detected == 1)
  {
    Serial.println("Flame detected...! take action immediately.");
    digitalWrite(buzzer, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
    delay(200);
    digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
    delay(200);
  }
  else
  {
    Serial.println("No flame detected. stay cool");
    digitalWrite(buzzer, LOW);
    digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  }
  delay(1000);
 

We have built a fire fighting robot based on this concept, which automatically detect the fire and pump out the water to put down the fire.
